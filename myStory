Long time ago in the town of Mentince, lived a miser. One day when he was returning home from the factory, he noticed that he had misplaced his purse containing a hundred gold coins.
In distress he goes to the town crier and asks for a solution. The crier suggests that he should announce a reward. The miser keeps a reward of 10 gold coins. Time passed but no one found
it.
